🌥️ ComposeGlass

ComposeGlass is a Jetpack Compose library designed to easily add a beautiful, performant, and customizable Glassmorphism blur effect to your Android apps, supporting Android 12+ natively and providing a custom blur solution for older Android versions.

🚀 Installation

Add this dependency to your module's build.gradle:

implementation("com.davidnavarro.composeglass:composeglass:1.0.0")

✨ How to Use

Applying the glassmorphism blur effect is straightforward:

```kotlin
Box(
    modifier = Modifier.glassMorphism {
        radius = 10
        gradientColors = listOf(Color.Cyan, Color.Magenta)
    }
) {
    Text("Beautiful Glass Blur!")
}
```

🎨 Customization Options

ComposeGlass allows you to finely tune the blur effect:

✅ Blur Radius

Controls how strong the blur effect is:

```kotlin
Modifier.glassMorphism {
    radius = 15 // Range: 1 - 25
}
```

🎭 Theme Modes

Adjust the blur effect for light or dark themes:
```kotlin
Modifier.glassMorphism {
    themeMode = GlassMorphismThemeMode.Dark // Auto | Light | Dark
}
```

🌈 Gradient Colors

Customize your blur effect with gradients:
```kotlin
Modifier.glassMorphism {
    gradientColors = listOf(Color.Blue, Color.Green)
}
```

🎨 Blur Background Color

Set a base color for the blur:
```kotlin
Modifier.glassMorphism {
    blurColor = Color.Red.copy(alpha = 0.2f)
}
```
